## DOMs: Design of a used oil furnace

Design of a used oil furnace from a mechatronics perspective. This is an improvement of what already exist and is based on the following research and implementation
## Basic description

- Pressurized oil flows through a nozzle.
- It is ignited at first and then burns on its own.
- Supercharger(Externally driven by a motor) can be added to maximize combustion.
- Ignition can be shifted from manual ignition to the use of gasoline+diesel mixture for ignition.
- Oil can be preheated also for maximum combustion

## Objectives

- High strength, and high temperature material for the design of the nozzle.(Oil atomizer)
- Automatic controlled flow of the oil.
- Automatic ignition.
- Design of a supercharger for maximum combustion(Miniblower).
- Automatic pressurizing of oil(regulator).
- Oil pre-heating
- Automatic switch over from diesel+gasoline ignition to oil burning independently.
- **Safety**

## Proposed designs

- Ignition system
- Nozzle
- Burning chamber
- preheating chamber

{Oil conveyance system}
