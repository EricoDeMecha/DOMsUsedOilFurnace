## DOMs: Design of a used oil furnace

Design of a used oil furnace from a mechatronics perspective. This is an improvement of what already exist and is based on the following research and implementation
## Basic description

- Pressurized oil flows through a nozzle.
- It is ignited at first and then burns on its own.
- Supercharger(Externally driven by a motor) can be added to maximize combustion.
- Ignition can be shifted from manual ignition to the use of gasoline+diesel mixture for ignition.
- Oil can be preheated also for maximum combustion

## Objectives

- High strength, and high temperature material for the design of the nozzle.(Oil atomizer)
- Automatic controlled flow of the oil.
- Automatic ignition.
- Design of a supercharger for maximum combustion(Miniblower).
- Automatic pressurizing of oil(regulator).
- Oil pre-heating
- Automatic switch over from diesel+gasoline ignition to oil burning independently.
- Smoke handling.(carbonmonoxide and smoke detectors)
- **Safety**

## Proposed designs

- Ignition system
- Nozzle
- Burning chamber
- preheating chamber

{Oil conveyance system}

## Findings and miscelleneous  section
1. Miscelleneous

According to this guy here with his bad boy ...

[![Material evidence](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qnzh19kDVuw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnzh19kDVuw)

* He has hit 1834 degrees by using silicon carbide in the burner and nozzle.
* He is using a thermal gun for temperature measurement and not the usual temperature industrial probe.
* Design of the nozzle
* Running at 3L/hr
* Design- simple design(Nozzle has blade with it, the blade closes the burner and can detached easily)
* Burner is also surrounded with another metal sheet to tap and direct more air directly to the flame.

2. Applications

* House warming during winter.
* Metal smelting.
